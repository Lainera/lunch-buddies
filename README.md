## Usage
Lunch Buddies is a web application for setting up your perfect lunch party!

Start your adventure into the world of social interactions by signing up on the Signup (/signup) page.
After you have successfully created your account and selected your interests, culinary preferences and desired budget, you are all set. If you change your mind later, no worries - you can change preferences on your Profile (/profile/[userID]) page.

On the home page you will see the list of all available buddies. Conditional filtering can be applied via drop-down filters. If you are really interested in discussing conspiracy theories or want to hang out with people that prefer Italian food - this could be a good idea.

As soon as you've figured out filtering, it's time to send some invitations! You can do that by either clicking the "Invite" button on the home page, or on other user's profile pages by clicking the same "Invite" button.

Since you are the one making the first step, you have the ability to choose the lunch party preferences, such as the budget and cuisines. Afterwards you can view your current lunch and the buddies who have accepted your invitation on the Lunch (/mylunch) page. Each member of the lunch party can send invitations to other users, so if you accept a pending invitation, you are able to invite people too!

To ditch the lunch, you can either click "Leave this Lunch" on the Lunch (/myLunch) page or just flip the "Available" toggle (in the invites drawer or on your Profile page). Flipping the "Available" toggle also removes you from the home page, as only available buddies are displayed.

Have fun lunchin'~!
