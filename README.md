## Usage
Lunch Buddies is an app for setting up your perfect lunch party!

Start your adventure into the world of social interactions by signing up on /signup page;
After you have successfully created your account and filled your interests, culinary preferences and desired budget - you are all set. If you change your mind later - no worries, you can change preferences on Profile page.

On homes page you will see the list of all available buddies. Conditional filtering may be applied via drop-down filters. If you are really interested in discussing conspiracy theories or want to hang out with people that prefer Italian food - this could be a good idea.

As soon as you've figured out filtering it's time to send some invitations! You can do that by either clicking "Invite" button on home page near, or on each users specific profile page by clicking the same "Invite" button.

Since you are the one making first step you have the ability to choose this particular lunch party preferences, such as budget and cuisines. Afterwards you can see your current lunch and people that have accepted your invitation on /mylunch page. Every member of the lunch party can send invitations to other users, so If you accept a pending invitation, you are able to invite people too. 

To ditch existing group you can either click "Leave this Lunch" on myLunch page or just flip the "Available" toggle. Flipping the "Available" toggle also hides you from the eyes of other users, since only available users are displayed on the main page.
